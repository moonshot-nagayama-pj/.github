# SNIQ: Scalable Network Infrastructure for Quantum

Open-source software and documents from [the Nagayama Moonshot project SNIQ](https://sniq.org/), part of the [Japan Science and Technology Agency's Moonshot goal 6: realization of a fault-tolerant universal quantum computer](https://www.jst.go.jp/moonshot/en/index.html).

Many of the contributors here are also members of the [AQUA research group](https://aqua.sfc.wide.ad.jp/) at [Keio University's Shonan Fujisawa Campus](https://www.sfc.keio.ac.jp/en/). [AQUA's GitHub organization](https://github.com/sfc-aqua/) contains more software, including [QuISP](https://github.com/sfc-aqua/quisp), a quantum network simulator.

## Software

* [PnPQ](https://github.com/moonshot-nagayama-pj/PnPQ): Python library for laboratory devices often used in quantum networking and computing testbeds, including common Thorlabs and OzOptics products.
* [tdc\_toolkit](https://github.com/moonshot-nagayama-pj/tdc_toolkit): Rust command-line interface and library, as well as Python bindings, for working with time-to-digital converters (TDCs) such as the PicoQuant MultiHarp 160.

## Documents

* [public-documents](https://github.com/moonshot-nagayama-pj/public-documents): Research and engineering documents, including:
    - [Timing Regimes in Quantum Networks](https://github.com/moonshot-nagayama-pj/public-documents/tree/main/timing-regimes): Exploring timing requirements for quantum networks from first principles.
    - Engineering process documents to govern our open-source projects and help other projects improve their open-source practices.
